## Introduction

FileSender is a web based application that allows authenticated users to securely and easily send arbitrarily large files to other users.  Authentication of users is provided through [SimpleSAMLphp](http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-idp#section_2), supporting SAML2, LDAP and RADIUS and more.  Users without an account can be sent an upload voucher by an authenticated user.  FileSender is developed to the requirements of the higher education and research community.

The purpose of the software is to send a large file to someone, have that file available for download for a certain number of downloads and/or a certain amount of time, and after that automatically delete the file.  The software is not intended as a permanent file publishing platform.
