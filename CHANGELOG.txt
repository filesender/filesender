       conditions could give a normal user access to the admin
       interface (#750).

       When upgrading from previous versions you should manually alter

       #sudo -u postgres psql filesender
         ALTER TABLE files ALTER fileto TYPE text;
         ALTER TABLE logs ALTER logto TYPE text;
         \q

     - Workaround for download of files with a double quote in the
       filename (#602).

Version 1.1 <5 November 2011>

	Major change since 1.0.1
	- Dropped Gears dependency, upload of large (>2G) files now requires
	  a browser that supports the HTML5 FileAPI, other browsers are
	  limited to 2G uploads using the Flash upload mechanism. This change
	  also obsoletes the following Gears-related issues in 1.0:

	  #176 >2GB upload on MacOS hangs at ~2GB (Gears enabled)
	  #290 File select fails in Linux/Gears for files of 2G or more.
	  #358 Filename accents not displayed in GUI when using Gears

	  This means that FileSender 1.1 also allows large uploads from
	  the Mac OSX and Linux platforms, provided a supported HTML5 browser
	  is used.

	- Note that only user visible references to Gears have been changed.
	  In the code and config.php references to 'gears' are still used. No
	  changes are required in config.php except for the URL pointing to
	  more information on HTML5:

	     $config['gearsURL'] = 'http://html5test.com/';

	Minor fixes and changes
	r993 filesender_db.sql: make fileauthuseruid character varying(500)
	     When upgrading from previous versions you should fix the relevant
	     column size in the database with:
              #sudo -u postgres psql filesender
              ALTER TABLE files ALTER fileauthuseruid TYPE character varying(500);
              \q
	#563 Compare of UID attribute with admin uid broken when attribute is
	     not in an array
	#569 Case-sensitive references to Files in cron.php
	#582 Inconsistent file size limit warnings
	#583 Email addresses rejected at maximum for uploads & voucher issue

	Packaging
	- The Debian package has been adapted to use the default baseurl
	  of the simplesamlphp 1.7+ debian packages which changed from
	 'simplesaml' to 'simplesamlphp' to adhere to standard Debian policy.

Version 1.0.1 <8 May 2011>

	Fixes and changes
	#271 compatibility fix for SimpleSAMLphp 1.7+
	#379 Log IPv6 address of connecting client. When upgrading from
	     previous versions you should fix the relevant column size in the
	     database with:
	      #sudo -u postgres psql filesender
	      ALTER TABLE files ALTER fileip6address TYPE character varying(45);
	      \q
	#380, #389, #390  fix the max_gears_upload_size check.
	#381 allow multiple email addresses to be separated by both a
	     comma and a semi-colon
	#383 trim whitespace from email-addresses

	           to Beta 0.1.17. If you need to downgrade to a previous version run
                   "php <filesenderbase>/scripts/convert-filenames.php revert" *before* downgrading.
