This file is used a sa placeholder to put notes about the new database
abstraction layer based on MDB, a PEAR package. In so far it is not in your
OS repository, google "install PEAR <platform>" and follow directions.

Then, do a systemwide install of MDB2 and its mysql and pgsql drivers:

pear install MDB2-2.5.0b3
pear install MDB2_Driver_mysql-1.5.0b3
pear install MDB2_Driver_pgsql-1.5.0b3

Note that you have to use 2.5.0b3 or later for PHP 5.3 compatibility, same for the drivers.
Also note that this version is fairly stable (more so than the stable version).
