This is the README.txt for version 1.6 of the FileSender software.

FileSender is a software package that implements a web-based application that
allows authenticated users to securely and easily send arbitrarily large files
to other users. Authentication of users is provided through SAML2, LDAP and
RADIUS. Users without an account can be sent an upload voucher by an
authenticated user. FileSender is developed to the requirements of the higher
education and research community.

The purpose of the software is to send a large file to someone, have that file
available for download for a certain amount of time, and after that
automatically delete the file. The software is not intended as a permanent
file publishing platform.

All major workflow actions (such as files or vouchers becoming available, or
being deleted) are signalled to both sender as well as recipient by means of
html-templated emails
