Remember to read the ChangeLog!!

IMPORTANT: UPGRADING FROM VERSIONS OLDER THEN 1.0-Beta-0.1.17
=============================================================
A new naming scheme to store files on the server was introduced in Beta-0.1.17.
Please run "php <filesenderbase>/scripts/convert-filenames.php" after upgrading
to Beta 0.1.17 or newer. If you need to downgrade to a previous version run
"php <filesenderbase>/scripts/convert-filenames.php revert" *before* downgrading.

YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THIS ONCE.  If you upgrade from for example Beta-0.1.18 to
RELEASE-1.0 you do not need to repeat this step.


IMPORTANT: Upgrading from previous betas
========================================
* you will need to re-apply any local changes you made
* files that you are likely to have changed are:
  - www/about.php
  - www/banner.png
  - www/help.php
  - config/config.php
  - www/js/fs_gears.js


Upgrading and CONFIG.PHP
========================
When upgrading:
* start with the fresh config.php and manually adjust it to reflect
  your configuration.  Merging your old config.php with the new one is
  discouraged.
* through various beta cycles several new and required settings have
  been added to the config.php that might not be present in your current
  configuration
* I repeat: when upgrading please start with a fresh configuration file
  and take the time to go through all configuration directives to make
  sure all is as it should be.

Upgrading and Gears chunksize
=============================
You might have changed the chunksize used in the gears upload.  This value is
found in www/js/fs_gears.js in the variable CHUNK_BYTES that has a default
value of 200000 (200KB).
