<h1>About {cfg:site_name} privacy</h1>
<p>
This service stores information about files in log files, including data about who is allowed to do something and what happens to files.
</p>
<p>
 Note that expired files are automatically deleted. If you delete a transfer, you also delete all related files and e-mails.
</p>
<p> {cfg:site_name} 'shreds' deleted files. Shredding involves overwriting the physical location of files. The actual data disappears. This gives you extra privacy. On this page you will find information about the retention period for log files.</p>
