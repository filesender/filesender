        Your user name and password information is handled outside of
        FileSender itself. You are free to delete your account on this
        FileSender installation which will remove all of your files,
        all the guests that you have invited, and any other debug
        information you might have sent to the server (failed upload,
        etc). Deleting your user account with FileSender removes all
        of this information and FileSender will no longer retain this
        information. Because FileSender does not have authority over
        your user name and password, they will remain active until you
        delete them from your institution.

        Because the user name and password checking is handled outside
        of FileSender you may be able to return to the system and
        login again. If you do this, you will appear as a new user to
        FileSender and will not be able to recover any of your old
        files or information because that has been completely deleted
        from FileSender when you deleted your FileSender account.
