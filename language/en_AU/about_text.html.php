<h1>Welcome to {cfg:site_name}</h1>
<p>
    {cfg:site_name} is an installation of 
    the FileSender project (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.filesender.org/" target="_blank">www.filesender.org</a>)
    which is a web based application that allows authenticated users to
    securely and easily send arbitrarily large files to other users.
</p>
<p>
    Authentication of users is provided through <a rel="nofollow" href="http://simplesamlphp.org/" target="_blank">
    SimpleSAMLphp</a>,
    supporting SAML2, LDAP and RADIUS and more. Users without an
    account can be sent an upload voucher by an authenticated user.
    FileSender is developed to the requirements of the higher
    education and research community.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the software is to send a large file to someone,
    have that file available for download for a certain number of
    downloads and/or a certain amount of time, and after that
    automatically delete the file. The software is not intended as a
    permanent file publishing platform.
