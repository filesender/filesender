## FileSender Roadmap 

  

Filesender is currently available as a v2 Beta release and the team is working towards a final stable release of the v2 software.  A full set of the features being developed or implemented in the v2 software is available [here](http://docs.filesender.org/v2.0/). 

The Filesender team is starting to collate items for roadmap development beyond Filesenderv2.0. Further features are entirely dependent on the funding that the project can attract.  To find out more about how you can donate to the project visit the Filesender Programme pages at the [Commons Conservancy](https://commonsconservancy.org/programmes/). 

Current priorities for the post 2.0 Filesender Roadmap are:

### Priority 1

* Bugfix release
* Object-store storage
* Complete automated CI tests
* Translation portal
* Packaging and documentation


### Priority 2

* Smooth UI
* Statistics
* Download link protection
* Improve TeraSender speed and robustness
* Address-book: link with group info sources
