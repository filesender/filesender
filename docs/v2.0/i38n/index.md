# Translation logic

Filesender includes a translation engine which allows for flexible user language detection and customization.

## How to contribute to the FileSender 2.0 translation effort

Starting with version 2.0 we are using www.poeditor.com to manage the different languages
FileSender supports.  If you want to contribute to a translation please follow the public
link to the FileSender 2.0 project in poeditor.com and follow the instructions you get
there:

[https://poeditor.com/join/project/RqXr9WBJwU](https://poeditor.com/join/project/RqXr9WBJwU)

After completing the sign-up process you should be able to add yourself to the language
you want to contribute to or add a new language and start translating right away!

## User language detection

FileSender builds the list of user languages by order of importance from various sources :

* From the url (`lang` url parameter) : allows for user language switching (only if `lang_url_enabled` set to true in config), if `lang_save_url_switch_in_userpref` is enabled in config and a user session exists the new language is saved in the user preferences so that he doesn't need to switch it again the nex time. If no user session is found the new choice is saved in the PhP session.
* From the browser's `Accept-Language` header : allows for automatic language detection base on the browser config (if `lang_browser_enabled` set to true in config)
* From `default_language` config parameter
* From absolute default `en`

## Dictionary loading

Translations are then loaded depending on the user language order, all more-preferred ones overriding less-preferred ones.

One can redefine translations just by creating a `language` directory under the `config` directory.

The `config/language` directory must have the same structure as the root `language` directory.

It is not necessary to copy all files, only the ones needing changes.

Any `lang.php` file under `config/language/some_lang` doesn't need to contain all translations, only the ones needing changes.

One can select available languages and their names by creating a `config/language/locale.php` file (same structure as `language/locale.php`).

## Translation process

When a translation is requested (UI display, email sending) the translated version is taken from the dictionary.

Then several replacements can occur (depending on the application code), the translation engine parses a simple markup language described below.

# Translation engine language

FileSender UI / emails translation engine includes a simple markup language with variable display, type formatting, conditional statements, loops ...

Variables come from the various replacement calls done on the translated content during it's processing.

Variables available in UI translations can be found in the `en_AU` language files most of the time.

Variables available in emails are described [a bit further](#email-variables)

## Variable display

Printing out the content of a variable is pretty straightforward :

	{variable_name}

If the variable contains an object (such as a `transfer`, a `recipient` ...) properties can be accessed as :

	{variable_name.property_name} (one can chain as many properties as needed)

If the variable is an array possible uses are :

	{variable_name.2} (get the item with index 2)

	{variable_name.foo} (get the item with index foo)

	{variable_name.first()} (get the first item)

	{variable_name.last()} (get the last item)

	{variable_name.nth(3)} (get the 4th item since arrays indexes are 0 based)

Variables can also be automatically converted to formatted version (depending on language) :

	{date:variable_name} (format as date)

	{datetime:variable_name} (format as date and time)

	{time:variable_name} (format as time)

	{size:variable_name} (format as a file size)

	{raw:variable_name} (no formatting and no output escaping, MUST BE USED CAREFULLY since it escape injection protection)

In case the variable resolves to an array without further key based access the number of items in the array will be returned :

If
	variable_name = ["foo", "bar"]

then
	{variable_name}

will print out "2".

All above access methods and formatters can be combined to achieve complex data fetching :

	{size:transfer.downloads.first().target.size}

	{transfer.files.last().downloads}

## Conditionals

Conditionals can be used to handle plural forms, display part of a text depending on variables ...

Nesting of conditionals is not supported. Variable printing and loops can be used in statements.

Basic syntaxes are (new lines allowed) :

	{if:condition}foo{endif}

	{if:condition}foo{else}bar{endif}

`condition` should be a boolean test, it can use available variables against a number of test operators.

Test operators are `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` :

	{if:transfer.files > 1}foo{else}bar{endif}

Logical operators can be used to build complex tests : AND (`&`) and OR (`|`) (AND operator takes precedence).

	{if:transfer.files>1 & recipient.downloads}foo{else}bar{endif}

	{if:transfer.files>1 & recipient.downloads | transfer.size>1234567890}foo{else}bar{endif} (here just having transfer.size over 1234567890 bytes leads to "foo" being printed)

Logical negation can also be used by putting `!` in front of the test sub-part.

	{if:transfer.files>1 & !recipient.downloads}foo{else}bar{endif}

## Loops

Loops can be used to sequentially print a list of items, syntax is :

	{each:transfer.files}File {item.name} ({size:item.size}){endeach}

Item name choosing for better readability (does not change result) :

	{each:transfer.files as file}File {file.name} ({size:file.size}){endeach}

Conditionals can be used inside loops :

	{each:transfer.files as file}File {file.name} ({size:file.size}) {if:file.size>1234567890}big file !{endif}{endeach}

Nesting of loops is not supported.

## Magic

### Config parameters

It is possible to use config values anywhere in the translations using any of the following syntaxes :

	{config:parameter_name}
	{conf:parameter_name}
	{cfg:parameter_name}

It is possible to use automatic formatting as well :

	{size:cfg:max_transfer_size}

### Email parts

When translating an email (file like `some_id.mail.php` or just `some_id.mail`, same effect) the translation file can contain several parts.

#### Headers

Anything before the first double line break is considered as headers. Headers a expressed like in a `key: value` format.

As of now only `subject` header is supported, if several subject lines are provided the last non-empty (after variables replacement) subject is used.

	subject: Foo
	subject: {bar}

	< mail contents >

In this exemple the sent mail subject will be "Foo" except if the `bar` variable contains something.

Using other translation syntaxes in headers is supported (only rule : headers have to be on a single line).

	subject: Foo
	subject: {if:bar & foo.bar != bar}Alt subject : {bar}{endif}

	< mail contents >

If no `subject` header is found the `site_name` config parameter will be used as subject, it is considered good practice to use a subject that tells what the email is about.

Additionally the `email_subject_prefix` config parameter value will be prepended to the subject.

#### Content parts

Mail translation can include either or both `text/plain` and `text/html` alternatives (they will be used depending on the configuration).

Start of `text/plain` part is signaled using `{alternative:plain}`

Start of `text/html` part is signaled using `{alternative:html}`

If the first part after the headers does not have a starting `alternative` tag its type will be set depending on what comes after in the mail :

* `plain` if an other part has a `{alternative:html}` starting tag
* `html` if an other part has a `{alternative:plain}` starting tag
* `html` if no other part is found but some html tags can be detected in the part
* `plain` if no other part is found and no html tags can be detected

It is usually considered a good practice to create both `html` and `plain` parts when translating FileSender emails.

When translating an email the newly created translation REPLACES the basic one, there is no parts overriding so even if one wants to only tweak the `html` part the `plain` part must be copied as well otherwise it will be missing when translating.

## How to import translations from poeditor to github

Early 2018 scripts were created to import language translations from
poeditor into a local checkout of the source from github. The intended
work flow is that you create a local git branch, import the translation
for one or more a languages, and then push up to github to make a pull
request to have the changes integrated into git master.

To get started you should login to poeditor.com and export the languages
of interest as php files.

The below command will then import a language file for the en_au translation.
You should be in the scripts/language directory of your FileSender git checkout.
The import script will override files in the language directory of your FileSender
git checkout with the information from the exported translation file.

```
$ cd ./scripts/language/
$ php import-translation-for-language.php  en_AU /tmp/FileSender_2.0_English_AU.php
```

Once you are happy with the update, by using git diff for example, you
should commit the branch and push to github to make a pull request to
merge the changes to the main repository.

### Adding more single translation files

Some translations are stored in the lang.php file and some are stored
into individual files in the language/en_AU (or similar) directory. To
cater for this the language/master directory contains a file for every
translation that should be placed in an individual file. These files
are named after the name of the translation they should contain. If a
translation does not go into a file then it will be stored into
lang.php.

The take away here is if you create a new file for mail etc then you
should also touch and commit an empty file in the language/master
directory to store that translation into the new file.

For example, a new transfer_shredded mail file would need a new file
in language/master called transfer_shredded.mail.php. The FileSender
codebase can then refer to that file and the translation scripts will
place the transfer_shredded translation into that file.

### Exporting new terms from the github code to poeditor

The poeditor.com site allows you to import files that describe new terms.
It was found that although it appeared that if the import file contained existing
terms that the system would only add the terms that are only in the import file there
were undesired side effects including some duplicate terms and some terms having their
values reset.

So the process to add any new terms that are in the github code but
not on poeditor is to first create a list of only the new terms and a
list of terms that have been deleted since the last import.

To keep things simple it is recommended to do term exports at around
release time and also store the list of terms that existed at the time
of the new term upload in git along with the source so you know what
can be used as the list of 'old terms' to create the new and deleted
list. Currently this exported term list is stored in allterms.txt in
the scripts directory as shown below.

Once a list of new terms is created it can be converted to
that poeditor understands (json) and uploaded to poeditor.
Deleted terms are a less common occurance and have to be found and
deleted manually thorugh the web interface.

The json file for new terms used in translations for any language in
the github code can be generated with the below commands. Notice that
the generated file is cached in the git repo for storage to help work
out the new terms the next time around.

The output of this run will be /tmp/deletedterms.txt with all the
terms that used to exist and no longer do and /tmp/newterms.json which
has only the new terms. Note that this script updates oldterms.txt
which should be committed to git so the next run knows exactly the
list of terms that were considered in the last execution.

```
cd scripts/language
./export-terms-to-new-and-deleted-lists.sh
```

The newterms.json file can them be imported using the "Import terms"
menu item on poeditor. This option is about the third icon on the
right menu of the poeditor web site as of 2018. After selecting the
newterms.json file you will see how many terms were parsed and how
many new terms were added by poeditor.


### Future directions

It is possible that the translation system might move to gettext or
something similar that can directly use the translation files that
poeditor can export. Shorter term it might be that the php exports are
automatically exported from poeditor to the github repository. This
step would allow a single execution of a script to convert those
exports into the formats expected by FileSender and would make
bringing in all language updates able to be done by running a single
script.
