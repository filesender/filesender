# How to update these Docs

If you see something on the
[docs.filesender.org](http://docs.filesender.org/) site that could use
an update we would love to hear from you.

There are many ways to update the documentation. If you are not a
developer then feel free to email your changes to the [Developer
Mailing List](/mailinglist). If you are willing to report issues with
the documentation we are happy to year from you! If you have
recommended changes then all the better.

If you are a developer the simplest way is to fork the [git
repository](https://github.com/filesender/filesender), checkout your
fork, make changes to the files in the docs directory, push those
changes back to github and open a pull request to incorporate your
changes. In other words, changes to the docs are just the same as
changes to the source code.
