# Reformatting

If you want to show a different user for formatting only changes then
the git commit should be done with something like
scripts/formatting/commit-as-formatter.sh which will set the author to
codeformatter so the change is known to be a reformat during a git
blame and the user can flick back to the previous change on a line to
see who actually authored a semantic change.

```

BRANCH=formatted123

git branch   $BRANCH
git checkout $BRANCH

./reformat-code.sh
```

# Sending in the changes

There is a handy script to do a commit of one or more things to git
with the author information set to a codeformatter user so that it is
obvious this is a style change that was machine generated.

```
./scripts/formatting/commit-as-formatter.sh classes

git push origin $BRANCH

```

On github the pull request will have to be merged with a "merge commit"
otherwise the author information will be compacted down to the person
making the pull request.
