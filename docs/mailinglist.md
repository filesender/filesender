# Support and Mailing lists

## FileSender uses three mailinglists and a ticketing system:

* Announcements: filesender-announce@filesender.org
* Support and development discussion: filesender-dev@filesender.org
* Bugs: [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/filesender/filesender/issues)
* Track: [Github commits](https://github.com/filesender/filesender/commits/master)

## Announcements

The FileSender project uses a mailinglist to announce new releases and important news:

filesender-announce@filesender.org

To subscribe send an email to sympa@filesender.org with 'subscribe
filesender-announce' in the subject or the body of the mail.
Alternatively you can go to the Sympa mailinglist server web interface
and subscribe yourself there.

[The mailinglist archive can be found
here](https://postlister.uninett.no/sympa_filesender/arc/filesender-announce)

## Support and development discussion

The FileSender project uses one mailinglist to coordinate the
development and provide support to the user community:

     filesender-dev@filesender.org

To subscribe send an email to sympa@filesender.org with 'subscribe
filesender-dev' in the subject or the body of the mail. Alternatively
you can go to the [Sympa mailinglist server web interface](https://postlister.uninett.no/sympa_filesender/info/filesender-dev) and subscribe
yourself there.

Non-subscribers can also send emails to the list - note that those
emails are moderated by one of three list-owners, so it can take a
little while before your email gets through.
