## FileSender project

FileSender is a web based application that allows authenticated users
to securely and easily send arbitrarily large files to other users.
Authentication of users is provided through [SimpleSAMLphp, supporting
SAML2, LDAP and RADIUS and
more](https://simplesamlphp.org/).
Users without an account can be sent an upload voucher by an
authenticated user. FileSender is developed to the requirements of the
higher education and research community.

The purpose of the software is to send a large file to someone, have
that file available for download for a certain number of downloads
and/or a certain amount of time, and after that automatically delete
the file. The software is not intended as a permanent file publishing
platform.

This is the home for Filesender documentation. For more information
about the project [please visit our homepage](https://filesender.org).

### Which version should you choose

The 2.x stream is a long standing release stream and is the current
stable release as at June 2024. The latest version can be obtained
from the [github releases
page](https://github.com/filesender/filesender/releases).

There are two active release streams; a version 2.x stream and a 3.x
stream. The 3.x beta release steam has a different UI and will become
the stable release at some stage.

Version 3 and Version 2 should have the same functionality but version
3 uses custom CSS to present a more modern UI. The uploaded files
storage handling is the same in version 2 and version 3. The database
schema is very similar between the two and should be identical at
specific release. For example, version 3.0alpha2 [explicitly
mentions](https://github.com/filesender/filesender/releases/tag/master3-filesender-3.0alpha2)
that it is feature compatible with 2.30. So you should be able to
direct 3.0alpha2 at the same uploaded files and database and have the
system function.

The release numbering for the 2.x series follows the pattern 2.1, 2.2,
2.30 etc. Each of these releases builds on version 2.0 adding bugfixes
and features. Each new release in the 2.x series will describe if
database updates are needed (most often by running a script) and if
web page templates have been updated in case you customize those on
your site. If is intended that you can migrate an active site to new
releases with very minimal downtime.

The very old 1.6.x series should not be used.

### Documentation

There are two distinct trees of documentation, one for [documentation
for versions 2.x](v2.0/) and one for [documentation for versions
3.x](v3.0/). These were identical as of June 2024 and will diverge as
updates are made to better describe the changes in the 3.x series over
time.
