## FileSender project

FileSender is a web based application that allows authenticated users
to securely and easily send arbitrarily large files to other users.
Authentication of users is provided through [SimpleSAMLphp, supporting
SAML2, LDAP and RADIUS and
more](http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-idp#section_2).
Users without an account can be sent an upload voucher by an
authenticated user. FileSender is developed to the requirements of the
higher education and research community.

The purpose of the software is to send a large file to someone, have
that file available for download for a certain number of downloads
and/or a certain amount of time, and after that automatically delete
the file. The software is not intended as a permanent file publishing
platform.

This is the home for Filesender documentation. For more information
