  * New features
    - FileSender now can handle filenames, subjects and personal messages in non-US-ASCII charsets
    - IMPORTANT: a new naming scheme to store files on the server was introduced. Please

                 "php <filesenderbase>/scripts/convert-filenames.php revert" *before* downgrading.
