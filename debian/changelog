filesender (0.1.17-1) stable; urgency=low

  * New features
    - FileSender now can handle filenames, subjects and personal messages in non-US-ASCII charsets
    - IMPORTANT: a new naming scheme to store files on the server was introduced. Please
                 run "php <filesenderbase>/scripts/convert-filenames.php" after upgrading
                 to Beta 0.1.17. If you need to downgrade to a previous version run
                 "php <filesenderbase>/scripts/convert-filenames.php revert" *before* downgrading.
    -  Many bug Fixes
