filesender (1.5~beta2) unstable; urgency=medium
   * Release 1.5-beta2

   * Major changes since 1.5-beta1
     - see http://www.assembla.com/spaces/file_sender/wiki/Installation_notes_for_1-5_development_code
       for important Upgrade notes
     - The ./config directory as distributed now only contains a sample
       config-dist.php file. All other templates/sample files have been
       moved to ./config-templates or their contents have been merged
       into the ./language/* files.
     - The supplied config-dist.php has been cleaned up and contains some 
       important changes. It is recommended to create an fresh config.php
       from the supplied config-dist.php file and adapt that one with your
       local settings.
     - Two database column type changes (needs manual adjustment when 
       upgrading).
     - Changed and consolidated language file naming scheme.
     - Added Czech, Slovenian, Italian, Spanish, Croatian and Hungarian
       language files.
     - Updated Dutch and Norwegian language files.

   * Major (less visible) changes since 1.5-beta1
     - Further improvements in workflow, validation/error handling and
       input/output pathways.
     - Minor bug fixes and enhancements.

filesender (1.5~beta1) unstable; urgency=medium
   * Release 1.5-beta1

   * Major changes since 1.0
     - Replaced Flash User Interface with a HTML-only interface
     - Dropped Gears dependency, upload of large (>2G) files now requires
       a modern HTML5 capable browser, other browsers are limited to 2G
       uploads (using a small Flash-application).
     - Added automatic language selection (English, Norwegian, Dutch)
     - Added Database Abstraction Layer (PDO) to facilitate the use
       of MySQL and possibly other databases as backend.

   * Major (visible) changes since earlier 1.5.0 development builds
     - Added French and German languages (contributed by RESTENA)
     - Replaced MDB2 with PDO DB Abstraction Layer

   * Major (less visible) changes since earlier development builds
     - Input/output pathways have been simplified
     - Input/output sanitisation and validation is done
     - Much code and program flow has been cleaned up and simplified
     - We now use mostly prepared statements for database interaction
     - All pages are now W3C compliant

filesender (1.1) testing; urgency=medium
   * Release 1.1
     
   * Major change since 1.0.1
     - Dropped Gears dependency, upload of large (>2G) files now requires
       a browser that supports the HTML5 FileAPI, other browsers are
       limited to 2G uploads using the Flash upload mechanism. This change
       also obsoletes the following Gears-related issues in 1.0:

       #176 >2GB upload on MacOS hangs at ~2GB (Gears enabled)
       #290 File select fails in Linux/Gears for files of 2G or more.
       #358 Filename accents not displayed in GUI when using Gears

       This means that FileSender 1.1 also allows large uploads from
       the Mac OSX and Linux platforms, provided a supported HTML5 browser
       is used.

     - Note that only user visible references to Gears have been changed.
       In the code and config.php references to 'gears' are still used. No
       changes are required in config.php except for the URL pointing to
       more information on HTML5:

          $config['gearsURL'] = 'http://html5test.com/';

   * Minor fixes and changes
     r993 filesender_db.sql: make fileauthuseruid character varying(500)
          When upgrading from previous versions you should fix the relevant
          column size in the database with:
              #sudo -u postgres psql filesender
              ALTER TABLE files ALTER fileauthuseruid TYPE character varying(500);
              \q
     #563 Compare of UID attribute with admin uid broken when attribute is
          not in an array
     #569 Case-sensitive references to Files in cron.php
     #582 Inconsistent file size limit warnings
     #583 Email addresses rejected at maximum for uploads & voucher issue

   * Packaging
     - The Debian package has been adapted to use the default baseurl
       of the simplesamlphp 1.7+ debian packages which changed from
      'simplesaml' to 'simplesamlphp' to adhere to standard Debian policy.
