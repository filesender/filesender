/**
 * This program will create a meduim sized dataset for testing FileSender
 * performance and migration. Some database performance issues will only show
 * up when a reasonable amount of data is available in the database. For example,
 * a sequential scan of a table might be a viable resolution when there are hundreds
 * of tuples but will likely give undesirable performance when there are 100k tuples.
 * Having a large dataset exported will also allow for migration tests to be
 * performed locally helping to resolve issues before users see them.
 *
 * Much of the work is handled using callbacks. For example, the performTransfers()
 * call passes each created transaction to an array of callbacks to allow for some files
 * to be downloaded, some transactions to be closed, and in general be able to create
 * a distribution of effects on a collection of transactions.
