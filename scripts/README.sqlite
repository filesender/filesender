sqlite support is contributed by Dick Visser from TERENA
Note that this is untested by the core FileSender team and
should be considered as an experimental feature.

Mini how-to:

* Uncomment the line that holds 'sqlite:/usr/share... etc ' in config/config.php
* apt-get install php5-sqlite sqlite3
* mkdir db
* sqlite3 db/filesender.sqlite < scripts/sqlite_filesender_db.sql
* chown -R www-data:www-data db

At this point the database works.

Despite the fact that there is no concept of usernames and passwords
in SQLite, it is mandatory to keep both $config['db_username'] and
$config['db_password'].
