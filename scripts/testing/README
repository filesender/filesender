This script should be run as root from the root directory
of the souce tree and will copy the source code to
/opt/filesenderetest
and modify the config file to enable local testing.

When testing upload and download of files and changes to that code
it can be useful to have random files with specific sizes. The sizes
allow testing around chunk boundaries. To aid in this the 
generate-testfiles-for-current-chunk-size.php and verify-testfile-download-hash.php
have been created.

The generate-testfiles-for-current-chunk-size.php takes one parameter which is
the location to create the test files and the script will generate a collection of files
with random data for testing.

That same location can be passed to verify-testfile-download-hash.php which also expects
the path of a downloaded file as parameter 2. The verify script will test the md5 hash
of your nominated file against the matching file in the generated test tree and report
if they match or not. Note that the verify script will truncate common browser additions
such as testfile-chunk0-1(1) back to find the base file name of testfile-chunk0-1.

Common usage is as follows

The same generated tree can be reused as desired
php generate-testfiles-for-current-chunk-size.php  /tmp/xx2

Files can be uploaded and downloaded in many browsers
upload /tmp/xx2/testfile-chunk0-1
download files to ~/Download/testfile-chunk0-1(1) testfile-chunk0-1(2) testfile-chunk0-1(3) and so on

Verify downloads with
php ./verify-testfile-download-hash.php /tmp/xx2  ~/Download/testfile-chunk0-1(3)
