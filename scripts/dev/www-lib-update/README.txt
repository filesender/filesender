The directory www/lib contains some third party libraries

The installation in that directory is kept to only the files
that might need to be served in order for FileSender to run.

This directory contains a package.json file that can be used 
with npm to install the libraries and specific versions and
the www/lib can then be updated from the directory tree
generated by npm.
