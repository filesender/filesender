Dear Sir, Madam,

The {siteName} service attempted to send an email to {fileoriginalto} on your behalf. 

The message was rejected by the remote site, the most common reason 
being an error in the email address entered for the recipient.

Please log into {siteName} to check the recipient address.

{siteName} allows adding new recipients to files without needing to upload the file again, from the table in "My Files". In the case of Vouchers however, a new voucher must be issued.

Best regards,

{siteName}{CRLF}{CRLF}--simple_mime_boundary{CRLF}Content-type:text/html; charset={charset}{CRLF}{CRLF}
